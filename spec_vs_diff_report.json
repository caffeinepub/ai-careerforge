  "summary": "The diff implements a substantial portion of the NEXUS portfolio requirements, including most frontend sections, the Motoko backend, accessibility settings, custom cursor, and the visual theme. However, several specific acceptance criteria are missing or only partially implemented, and the Motoko backend has structural issues relative to the spec. Several advanced animation requirements are simplified or absent.",
